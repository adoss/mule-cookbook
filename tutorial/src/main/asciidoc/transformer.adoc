=== Adding a Transformer

==== What is a Transformer?
Transformers convert message payloads to formats expected by their destinations. Mule ESB provides many standard transformers, which users can configure using elements and attributes in a Mule XML configuration file.

Sometimes it's useful to build custom transformers.

Annotating a method with @Transformer signals the DevKit to export a method functionality as a transformer. You need to declare Transformers in classes annotated with @Module or @Connector and you can declare more than one transformer in a single class. It is possible to declare transformers, message processors, and message sources all in the same class.

An @Transformer annotated method must:

* Be static
* Be public
* Not return void
* Not return java.lang.Object
* Receive exactly one argument
* Be inside a class annotated with @Connector

==== Creating a Transformer

In our case, we are creating a transformer that converts a +List<Recipe>+ into a +List<Map<String,Object>>+, that way we don't need to modify our existing operation, and yet we can use the output of it in operations that recieve a +List<Map<String,Object>>+.

==== Using Your Transformer in a Mule App

To use your transformer, just drag and drop it from the palette.
