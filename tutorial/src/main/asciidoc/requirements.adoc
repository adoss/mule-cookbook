= Prerequisites

To develop a connector you should have a working knowledge of Mule, Anypoint Studio, and Java development in general, specifically the use of Java annotations.

DevKit's functionality is exposed to connector developers through http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/[Java annotations] that generate code and files to interact with Mule, and Anypoint Studio. The generated code provides the interface between the connector and Mule that would otherwise require each connector developer to include extensive boilerplate code, as well as the code and files required to interact with your connector in Anypoint Studio.

You can develop a connector using Windows, Mac, or Linux.

== Setup environment

* Download and install http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Java 1.7 JDK].
* Download and install http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven]. If you're new to Maven, read http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html[Maven in 5 Minutes].
* Download http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio[Anypoint Studio].
* Check http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Maven+Support+in+Anypoint+Studio[Maven configuration] in Anypoint Studio.
* Install Anypoint DevKit plugin.
* Install a http://git-scm.com/downloads[GitHub] client.

WARNING: JRE is not suited for development, you need to have a JDK installed.

== Import the Cook Book

* Clone https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-cookbook[tutorial] repository into your local machine.
Lets say I have a *dev* folder where I want to clone it.
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/dev
git clone https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-cookbook.git
----

* Go to the cloned directory and run:
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/dev/mule-cookbook
mvn install eclipse:eclipse
----

* After it finishes just go to your Anypoint Studio and import the root project as an existing project.
